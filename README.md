# Epstein Files: Structured Data Exports

Structured data exports from the forensic analysis of the 218GB DOJ Jeffrey Epstein file release (all 12 datasets + House Oversight Estate + FBI Vault: 1,385,916 documents, 2,771,231 pages).

I have threaded through these databases into a searchable visual interface, with an AI-assistant, at https://epstein-data.com

You can also install my full Claude-powered Epstein Investigator setup yourself, by following the directions for the: [desktop install](https://epstein-data.com/investigate), or [CLI version](https://epstein-data.com/investigate_cli).

Note the latest release, v5.1, at: https://github.com/rhowardstone/Epstein-research-data/releases/tag/v5.1

**Results repo:** [Epstein-research](https://github.com/rhowardstone/Epstein-research) — 165+ forensic investigation reports with DOJ source citations.

## What's Here

### Knowledge Graph (Curated)

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `knowledge_graph_entities.json` | 606 | Curated entities: people, shell companies, organizations, properties, aircraft, locations. Each entry includes aliases, metadata (occupation, legal status, mention counts), and entity type. |
| `knowledge_graph_relationships.json` | 2,302 | Relationships between entities with types (traveled_with, associated_with, owned_by, victim_of, etc.), weights, date ranges, and source/target entity names. |

**Note on knowledge graph:** The knowledge graph was curated during the initial investigation phases and does not include NER (Named Entity Recognition) run against the full OCR corpus. It covers the most frequently-referenced and manually-verified entities. For comprehensive name extraction from the full text, see `extracted_entities_filtered.json` below or query the full databases directly.

### Person Registry

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `persons_registry.json` | 1,614 | Unified person registry merged from 9 sources: epstein-pipeline (1,195), knowledge-graph (285), la-rana-chicana (237), Wikipedia Epstein files list (45), Bondi PEP letter Feb 2026 (19), jmail.world (9), corpus-investigation (2), khanna-massie-2026 (2), and doj-release-2026 (1). Each entry includes name, aliases, category (political/business/academic/staff/financial/legal/media/other), search terms, and source attribution. |

**Note:** This registry is broader than the knowledge graph — it includes every named individual identified across all investigation phases, congressional disclosures, and cross-referenced sources. Categories reflect the person's primary role relative to the Epstein case, not an accusation. Many entries (e.g., Bondi PEP letter names) appear in the files only in incidental contexts such as news clippings or tips.

### Entity Extraction (Filtered from 107K raw)

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `extracted_entities_filtered.json` | 8,085 | Filtered entity extractions: 3,881 names (appearing in 2+ documents), 2,238 phone numbers, 1,489 amounts, 357 emails, 116 organizations. Each entry includes the EFTA document numbers where it appears. |
| `extracted_names_multi_doc.csv` | 3,881 | Names appearing in multiple EFTA documents with document counts and sample EFTA references. CSV format for easy browsing. |

**Note on quality:** The raw extraction table contains 107,422 entities, many of which are OCR artifacts from redacted/degraded documents. The filtered exports remove garbled text and require multi-document co-occurrence for names.

### Image Catalog

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `image_catalog.csv.gz` | 38,955 | Complete image catalog (gzipped). Fields: id, image_name, efta_number, page_number, people, text_content, objects, setting, activity, notable, analyzed_at. |
| `image_catalog_notable.json.gz` | 38,864 | Images with people or notable content identified (gzipped JSON). Truncated fields for manageable size. |

### Document Summaries

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `document_summary.csv.gz` | 519,438 | Per-document redaction summary for every EFTA document (gzipped). Fields: efta_number, total_redactions, bad_redactions, proper_redactions, has_recoverable_text, dataset_source. |

### Reconstructed Pages (High Interest)

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `reconstructed_pages_high_interest.json.gz` | 39,588 | Pages where hidden text was recovered from under redactions (gzipped JSON). Fields include efta_number, page_number, num_fragments, reconstructed_text, interest_score, and names_found. Higher interest scores indicate more substantive recovered content. |

### EFTA-to-DOJ URL Mapping

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `efta_dataset_mapping.csv` | EFTA number ranges for each of the 12 DOJ datasets, with URL templates. |
| `efta_dataset_mapping.json` | Same mapping in JSON format for programmatic use. |

**URL Pattern:** `https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%20{N}/EFTA{XXXXXXXX}.pdf`

| Dataset | EFTA Start | EFTA End |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 00000001 | 00003158 |
| 2 | 00003159 | 00003857 |
| 3 | 00003858 | 00005586 |
| 4 | 00005705 | 00008320 |
| 5 | 00008409 | 00008528 |
| 6 | 00008529 | 00008998 |
| 7 | 00009016 | 00009664 |
| 8 | 00009676 | 00039023 |
| 9 | 00039025 | 01262781 |
| 10 | 01262782 | 02205654 |
| 11 | 02205655 | 02730264 |
| 12 | 02730265 | 02858497 |

**Note:** EFTA numbers are assigned **per page**, not per document. A multi-page document consumes consecutive EFTA numbers — e.g., EFTA00008320 (89 pages) covers Bates numbers 00008320–00008408, and Dataset 5 begins at EFTA00008409. There are **no gaps** between datasets; every apparent gap is accounted for by multi-page documents at dataset boundaries.

## DOJ Document Removal Audit

The [`doj_audit/`](doj_audit/) directory documents an audit of the DOJ Epstein Library that identified documents removed or altered after the initial public release.

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `doj_audit/CONFIRMED_REMOVED.csv` | 67,784 | Documents confirmed removed from the DOJ website (returning HTTP 404). Fields: efta, justice_gov_url, dataset, pages, scan_content_length, scan_last_modified. |
| `doj_audit/FLAGGED_documents.csv` | 96,112 | All flagged documents with DOJ URLs and dataset info. |
| `doj_audit/FLAGGED_documents_details.csv` | 102,223 | Flagged documents with detailed metadata including status, category, document type, priority score, confidence, and text preview. |
| `doj_audit/SIZE_MISMATCHES.csv` | 23,989 | Documents where the file size on the DOJ server differs from the originally ingested version, suggesting post-release modification. |
| `doj_audit/sample_verification_results.csv` | 500 | Statistical sample verification of flagged 404s using browser-based checks. |

## Processing Tools (Replication Pipeline)

The [`tools/`](tools/) directory contains all Python scripts used to build the databases from raw PDFs. Use these to replicate the analysis, extend it with new data, or adapt for your own pipeline.

All tools auto-detect the data directory (no path editing needed). They check the `EPSTEIN_DATA_DIR` environment variable first, then look relative to the script and current working directory. If auto-detection fails: `export EPSTEIN_DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/data`

### Core Pipeline

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tools/ingest_house_estate.py` | Ingests House Oversight Estate documents (Concordance format, OCR with configurable workers) |
| `tools/ingest_spreadsheets.py` | Ingests native XLS/XLSX/CSV files into full_text_corpus.db |
| `tools/transcribe_media.py` | GPU transcription of audio/video using faster-whisper large-v3 |
| `tools/prescreen_media.py` | Pre-screens media files to classify and skip surveillance footage |
| `tools/redaction_detector_v2.py` | Spatial redaction analysis: finds black rectangles, extracts underlying text |
| `tools/build_person_registry.py` | Builds unified person registry from 6 sources |
| `tools/build_knowledge_graph.py` | Constructs entity relationship graph |
| `tools/build_native_files_catalog.py` | Generates NATIVE_FILES_CATALOG.csv |

### Search & Analysis

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tools/person_search.py` | FTS5 cross-reference search with co-occurrence analysis and CSV export |
| `tools/congressional_scorer.py` | Scores documents by redacted-name density for congressional reading room prioritization |
| `tools/generate_gov_reports.py` | Searches corpus for current government officials |
| `tools/search_judicial.py` | Searches corpus for federal judges |
| `tools/extract_subpoena_riders.py` | Extracts and catalogs subpoena rider documents |

### Data Integrity

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tools/find_missing_efta.py` | Gap detection across EFTA numbering |
| `tools/recover_missing_efta.py` | Recovers missing EFTAs from DOJ server or forensic carving |
| `tools/run_post_ingestion_pipeline.sh` | Chains all post-ingestion steps (transcription, registry, catalog) |

## Integration Notes

For developers building tools on top of this data:

- EFTA numbers are the universal key. Every document in the DOJ release has one.
- The `efta_dataset_mapping` files let you resolve any EFTA number to a DOJ PDF URL.
- Entity `efta_numbers` arrays give you cross-references: "this person appears in these documents."
- Knowledge graph `weight` on relationships indicates strength of connection (higher = more documented).
- Image `image_name` format is `EFTA{number}_p{page}_i{index}_{hash}.png` — parse EFTA number and page from the filename.
- **No inter-dataset gaps:** EFTA numbers are per-page, so a multi-page terminal document in each dataset consumes the EFTA numbers up to the next dataset's start. There are no missing files between datasets.
